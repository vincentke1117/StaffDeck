## News

- 📌 **Pinned · 2026-07-15**: StaffDeck is now open source! We welcome your feedback and support with a Star.

# 💡 About StaffDeck

StaffDeck is an enterprise platform for building and managing digital employees. It helps professionals turn their work experience, business processes, and decision criteria into digital employees that can operate continuously, take over repetitive tasks, and preserve individual expertise as reusable, evolvable, and traceable organizational assets. StaffDeck is jointly developed by the [ModelBest](https://modelbest.cn/), [NEU-ModelBest Data Intelligence Joint Lab](https://neuir.github.io/), [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [OpenBMB](https://www.openbmb.cn/home), and [AI9Stars](https://github.com/AI9Stars) for enterprises and institutions seeking to advance AI from a personal productivity tool to an organizational capability.

## Core Features

- 🧑‍💼 **Build and manage digital employees**: Turn professional experience, processes, and decision criteria into digital employees with positions, employee IDs, capability profiles, and work records. Support capability growth, permission isolation, publishing, and reuse.
- 🧩 **State-machine-driven procedural skills**: Generate structured SOPs from natural language and use state machines to execute complex processes accurately. Support real-time switching across multiple flows, context preservation, visual editing, version management, and branch evolution.
- 📚 **Document-structure-aware knowledge retrieval**: Build navigable indexes across documents, chapters, pages, summaries, and other levels, allowing digital employees to first estimate where information may reside and then locate the original text step by step. Support knowledge buckets, targeted retrieval, source citations, and retrieval debugging.
- 🔌 **Autonomous execution and continuous improvement**: Perform real business operations through HTTP APIs, MCP, and scheduled tasks, then close the improvement loop with long-term memory, complete traces, human takeover, user feedback, and feedback analysis.

## Agent-Friendly Quick Deploy

Paste the prompt below into Cursor, Claude Code, or Codex:

```text
Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBMB/StaffDeck/main/README.md.
Clone the OpenBMB/StaffDeck repository, prepare Python 3.11 and Node.js 20,
create backend/.venv, install the backend and frontend dependencies, copy
backend/.env.example to backend/.env, ask me for the OpenAI-compatible model
endpoint and API key if they are missing, run DETACH=1 scripts/dev_up.sh, and
verify /api/health plus /workspace/gallery before reporting success.
```

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- macOS, Linux, or WSL when using the development scripts
- Python **3.11+**
- Node.js **20+** and npm
- An OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint and API key
- No CUDA requirement for the application itself; hardware requirements depend on the selected model service

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenBMB/StaffDeck.git
cd StaffDeck

python3 -m venv backend/.venv
backend/.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e "backend[dev]"
npm --prefix frontend-enterprise ci
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

### 2. Configure a Model

Edit `backend/.env` before the first startup:

```dotenv
APP_SECRET="replace-with-a-long-random-secret"
DEMO_MODEL_BASE_URL="https://your-openai-compatible-endpoint/v1"
DEMO_MODEL_NAME="your-model-name"
DEMO_MODEL_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

The API key is used to create the initial model configuration and is encrypted before being stored in the database. Do not commit `backend/.env`. After startup, model services can also be managed from **Admin → Model Configuration**.

### 3. Launch the Web Demo

```bash
DETACH=1 scripts/dev_up.sh
```

The script builds the StaffDeck frontend and serves the UI, API, and Swagger documentation from one FastAPI process on port `5173`.

Initial administrator credentials: username `admin`, password `admin`. Please change the password after first login.

### 4. Verify the Installation

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5173/api/health
```

Expected output:

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173/workspace/gallery](http://127.0.0.1:5173/workspace/gallery), select a digital employee, and send the first message. The answer and its execution record should stream into the same conversation turn.

### Useful Commands

```bash
scripts/dev_status.sh       # inspect service status
scripts/dev_down.sh         # stop the local service
scripts/dev_up.sh           # run in the foreground
```

## Core Workflows

1. **Create a digital employee**: Define the position, role boundaries, service style, creator, and access scope.
2. **Configure employee capabilities**: Copy from the marketplace or create knowledge bases, general skills, SOPs, and tools without modifying marketplace originals.
3. **Start a session**: Enter from the digital employee marketplace or employee list; the formal session is persisted after the first message is sent.
4. **Execute and observe**: Inspect streaming intent, retrieval, skill, tool, review, and response events in the execution record.
5. **Intervene when necessary**: Continue with queued requests, cancel a run, hand work to a person, or process pending answers.
6. **Operate continuously**: Improve employee capabilities over time through memory, feedback, conversation logs, and scheduled tasks.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>The page opens, but the digital employee does not answer.</strong></summary>

Check the selected model configuration, API key, model name, and model service network. Then inspect the execution record and `.dev/logs/app.log` to identify the exact error returned by the model service.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can StaffDeck run without a local GPU?</strong></summary>

Yes. The application calls an OpenAI-compatible model endpoint, so GPU requirements depend on the model service you deploy or use.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why can regular users use marketplace resources but not edit them?</strong></summary>

Marketplace resources are reusable templates. Regular users can copy or bind authorized resources to their own employees, while the original resources remain protected by creator and administrator permissions.
</details>

## Roadmap

- [ ] Group chat, multi-digital-employee communication, and task division
- [ ] More enterprise connectors and reviewed marketplace resources
- [ ] Fine-grained approval policies for high-risk tool actions

Roadmap priorities are driven by real deployment needs. Please open an [Issue](https://github.com/OpenBMB/StaffDeck/issues) with a reproducible scenario and expected behavior.

## Contributing

Contributions from collaborators with repository access are welcome:

- Submit reproducible bugs and permission issues
- Propose digital employee, knowledge, skill, SOP, or tool workflows
- Submit focused pull requests with tests and browser validation
- Improve documentation and Chinese/English translations

Keep unrelated worktree changes intact, add tests proportional to the affected behavior, and state the routes and user roles used for UI verification in each pull request.

## Risks and Limitations

- Model responses can be incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent. Execution records improve auditability but do not guarantee correctness.
- Knowledge retrieval quality depends on source-document quality, parsing, indexing, permissions, and model capabilities.
- External tools and generated runners can have real side effects. Use least-privilege credentials and configure human approval for high-risk actions.
- Scheduled tasks depend on a continuously running worker and correct user time-zone settings.
- This project is not a substitute for professional review in legal, medical, financial, security, or other regulated fields.
- Do not use this platform to process data or automate important decisions without appropriate authorization, privacy protection, and human oversight.
